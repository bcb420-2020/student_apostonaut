#notes for A3
MARCH 22 2020
-ran GSEA on ranked gene list, with p-value 0.05. Used file from bader lab website that was recommended in class:
http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/February_01_2020/Human/symbol/Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_February_01_2020_symbol.gmt
-saw interesting top hit for upregulated genes: "	NEGATIVE REGULATION OF CANONICAL WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY%GOBP%GO:0090090"
-in A2, this gene set came up as significant, but was not at the very top. It is interesting now that "non-significant" genes (i.e. genes with less upregulated expression ) are factoring in and we are seeing this gene set as being the most significant.
-this gene set is a good candidate for investigation into a pathway in more detail

-I have downloaded the Enrichment Map app for Cytoscape and generated an enrichment map using the GSEA results.
