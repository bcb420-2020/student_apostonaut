#notes for A3
MARCH 22 2020
-ran GSEA on ranked gene list, with p-value 0.05. Used file from bader lab website that was recommended in class:
http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/February_01_2020/Human/symbol/Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_February_01_2020_symbol.gmt
-saw interesting top hit for upregulated genes: "	NEGATIVE REGULATION OF CANONICAL WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY%GOBP%GO:0090090"
-in A2, this gene set came up as significant, but was not at the very top. It is interesting now that "non-significant" genes (i.e. genes with less upregulated expression ) are factoring in and we are seeing this gene set as being the most significant.
-this gene set is a good candidate for investigation into a pathway in more detail

- for GSEA, used following parameters: -nperm 1000 -set_max 200 -set_min 15 -rnk $rnk -collapse false
-I have downloaded the Enrichment Map app for Cytoscape and generated an enrichment map using the GSEA results.  
-haven't yet figured out how to run GSEA from within the R notebook. I also encountered a problem when trying to read the .xls na_pos/na_neg files. The quote character " ' " was causing issues with reading files and delimiters. I found a solution: 
> read.table(file=pos.file, header = F, stringsAsFactors = F, sep="\t", quote = "\"")
adding the quote = "\"" excapes the quote and prevents this error

Command to get all genes in leading edge:
$ cat "NEGATIVE REGULATION OF CANONICAL WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY%GOBP%GO:0090090.xls" | awk '$NF=="Yes"' | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq

Genes in leading dge of above term:
-ANKRD6 APOE AXIN2 BMP2 DACT3 DKK1 DKK2 DRAXIN GLI1 IGFBP2 KREMEN1 KREMEN2 LRP4 MAPK8IP1 MAPK8IP2 MLLT3 NOTUM PTPRU SFRP1 SLC9A3R1 TMEM170B
Genes in canonical Wnt pathway, which are present in gene sets in Cytoscape:
-APC AXIN1 AXIN2 CTNNB1 CTNND1 CTNND2 DVL1 DVL2 DVL3 FZD6 FZD7 FZD9 GSK3A GSK3B LRP4 LRP6 TCF7L2 WNT11 WNT3A WNT5A

SAHA Drugbank entry:
Vorinostat%DrugBank%DB02546	Vorinostat	HDAC6	HDAC2	HDAC1	HDAC3	HDAC8

In GSEA results, we have "na_pos" and "na_neg" files. "na_pos" refers to gene sets which are upregulated in SAHA-treated dHAECs. I will looke at top 15 results for each file and give a summary of top results

Comparison with A2:
In assignment 2: 
Upregulated: protein localization, lytic vacuole/lysosome, Axonogenesis, wnt signaling, (Ras) GTPase binding, and synapse-related terms.
Downregulated: DNA replication, cell cycle checkpoint, and chromosome segregation gene sets, retinoblastoma Gene in Cancer 

HDAC expression:
"HDIs bind to the zinc-containing catalytic domain of the histone deacetylase (HDACs) and they repress the deacetylase enzymatic activity. " (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6480157/)
-interestingly, expression of HDACs in SAHA-treated dHAECs is increased for the mostpart:
